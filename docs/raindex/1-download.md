# Download

The Raindex app is an open source, standalone app you can use to write, deploy and manage your orders. The front-end is self-hosted and anyone could build from source. 

The app is in its early development stages and contracts are unaudited so be careful and as always, DYOR.

Available for Intel or Apple Silicon running macOS 14.

[Download (Apple Silicon - M1, M2 etc)](https://github.com/rainlanguage/rain.orderbook/releases) and select the latest aarch64.dmg file

[Download (Intel Mac)](https://github.com/rainlanguage/rain.orderbook/releases/) and select the latest x64.dmg file

## Linux and Windows support

Immediate and native support for Linux/Windows is on the roadmap, however for now its best if you [join our Telegram](https://t.me/+w4mJbCT6IfI2YTU0) where we can support directly.
