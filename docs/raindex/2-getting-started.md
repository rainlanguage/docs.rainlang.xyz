### Download the app

First, head to the [download page](./1-download.md) and get a copy of the app.

### Settings

When you open the app for the first time you won't see any orders or vaults. This is because there can be many Raindex orderbook contracts across many chains, so you'll need to set them up.

1. Visit pubstrats to grab the latest settings for raindex, at https://github.com/rainlanguage/rain.dex.pubstrats/blob/main/src/settings.yml
2. Copy settings ready to add to your app
3. Loading raindex, head to the settings page (link in the sidebar of the app)
4. Paste the settings into the input box
5. Apply settings

Note: 
In releases from October 2024 onwards settings will be automatically applied.
In releases prior to October 2024 click 'Apply settings' to ensure your settings are applied.

New versions of Rainlang and Raindex are being deployed often so head over to the [Rainlang Telegram](https://t.me/+w4mJbCT6IfI2YTU0) to keep up with updates.

### Deploying your first order

You should now see orders and vaults across multiple networks on the Orders and Vaults pages.

Try deploying your first order by following one of [the examples](./example-strats/1-examples.md).
