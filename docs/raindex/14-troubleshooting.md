# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues
1. **Network Connectivity**
   - RPC endpoint availability
   - Chain ID mismatches
   - Network synchronization issues

2. **Subgraph Problems**
   - Indexing delays
   - Query failures
   - Schema mismatches

3. **Contract Integration**
   - Address resolution failures
   - Network mismatches
   - Permission issues

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify network connectivity and RPC endpoints
2. Check subgraph synchronization status by pinging the graphql endpoint.
3. Validate contract deployments, check the contracts within the block explorer.
4. Review network references
5. Test metaboard indexing

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Use secure RPC endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for network issues

### Contract Security
- Verify contract source code
- Check deployment parameters
- Monitor contract interactions

## Development Tools
- Network testing utilities
- Subgraph explorers
- Contract verification tools
- Configuration validators
